Liberal Democrat James MacCleary says his party supports the UK complying with international law - but describes the process of handing the Chagos Islands to Mauritius as "bumpy".
He says it was "clear that the government was prepared to give Donald Trump" veto powers over an agreement, "without regard" for Chagossian priorities.
Now that a deal has been reached, he asks, how has the government responded to their concerns and priorities?
Healey responds by saying that the government kept the US informed about the treaty, but never offered Washington a veto over it.
