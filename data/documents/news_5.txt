Most doctors and teachers in England have been handed a 4% pay rise after the government accepted recommendations from pay review bodies.
The awards are higher than the 2.8% it previously budgeted for, with ministers saying most of the remainder will have to come from existing budgets.
Education unions have broadly welcomed the decision, while warning of cuts to school budgets without extra funding to cover costs.
But health unions have reacted angrily after a smaller rise of 3.6% was offered for NHS staff other than doctors, including nurses and midwives.
The health department says junior doctors, now known as resident doctors, will get an average rise of 5.4% due to a Â£750 top-up.
