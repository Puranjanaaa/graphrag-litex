Israel has been battling intense international and domestic criticism over the conduct of the Gaza war in recent days.
While Israeli ministers have condemned this shooting outside a Jewish museum in Washington DC as an act of antisemitism, there have also been strong recriminations.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a post on X: "We are witness to the terrible cost of the antisemitism and wild incitement against the State of Israel."
Foreign Minister Gideon Saar pointed to "anti-Israeli incitement", which he said is done by "leaders and officials of many countries, of international organisations, especially from Europe".
Earlier this week, the leaders of the UK, France and Canada signed a strongly-worded joint letter condemning Israelâ€™s actions in Gaza.
