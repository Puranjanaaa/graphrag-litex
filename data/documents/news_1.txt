Speaking to reporters back at his Washington hotel, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has downplayed the drama that played out in the White House during his meeting with his US President Donald Trump.
Ramaphosa faced a tough time in the Oval Office after he was ambushed with videos purporting to show the persecution of a white genocide â€“ a claim that has been discredited.
The South African president shared details from the lunch that followed the confrontation, saying his team had a "robust engagement" and a "rather pleasant lunch" with the Trump administration, where issues such as golf and trade and investment were discussed.
"I was rather pleased that there was a rather firm agreement and undertaking that we're going to continue engaging," he told South African media after the briefing.
Ramaphosa insisted that the visit was a "great success", and that while the South African media "wanted to see drama", he was "sorry we disappointed you somewhat".
He also mentioned that he now expects Trump to attend the G20 summit in Johannesburg later this year.
