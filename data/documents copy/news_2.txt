A study has found that clownfish, similar to those made famous by the movie Finding Nemo, are shrinking in response to marine heatwaves. Researchers observed that clownfish living on coral reefs in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, significantly slimmed down during a spike in ocean temperatures in the summer of 2023.
Dr. Theresa Rueger, a senior lecturer in Tropical Marine Sciences at Newcastle University, noted, “Nemos can shrink, and they do it to survive these heat stress events.” The research involved measuring individual clownfish in the wild as they adapted to increased heat stress.
The phenomenon is part of a broader trend, with growing evidence that animals—including birds, lizards, and insects—are changing their shapes and sizes to cope with climate change.
The heatwave in 2023 also led to widespread coral bleaching. Kimbe Bay, a region known for its rich marine biodiversity, was the site of this study, which helps scientists understand why fish sizes are declining globally.
