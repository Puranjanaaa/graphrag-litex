Mauritius Prime Minister Dr Navin Ramgoolam has hailed the deal over the Chagos archipelago as a "great victory for the Mauritian nation", saying that 60 years after independence, "the United Kingdom must now return our full sovereignty".
Speaking with visible emotion, Ramgoolam reaffirmed his long-standing position.
"I have always said we must obtain our sovereignty over the totality of the Chagos, including Diego Garcia."
He described this development as the final step in completing Mauritius’ decolonisation, which began with independence in 1968.
"What we want is absolute sovereignty without compromise or ambiguity," Ramgoolam stated. "The Chagossians must be able to live once again on their islands."
Negotiations between Mauritius and the UK have also included discussions around financial reparations (see our earlier post).
Mauritius will receive £165 million through a front-loading agreement, which amounts to over 10 billion Mauritian rupees annually for the next 28 years.
