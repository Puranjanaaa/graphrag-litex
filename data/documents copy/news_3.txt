There's been some discord among members of Trump's own party over his "big, beautiful bill", which will now go to the Senate, and Republicans there are working on their own tweaks.
Here's a look at where the disagreements lie:
How much to cut?
Trump and his congressional allies are trying to satisfy both budget hawks who want deeper spending cuts and Republicans who want tax reductions but worry about the effects of cutting some programmes.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would, over the next decade, add about $2.3 trillion (£1.7tn) to the national debt, which is currently around $36.2tn (£27tn).
Medicaid
Perhaps the most contentious item in the bill are cuts - partly through work requirements - to Medicaid, a healthcare programme aimed at lower-income Americans.
Some Republicans are pressing for the bill to go further, while others have argued against any cuts to Medicaid, warning they would hurt millions of lower-income constituents.
