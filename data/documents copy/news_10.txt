Tottenham Hotspur have never even participated in the Uefa Super Cup, let alone lifted it.
The Uefa Super Cup was founded in 1973 - just after Tottenham had won the Uefa Cup for the first time.
However, when Spurs won the competition again in 1984, the Uefa Super Cup was actually contested between the winners of the Champions League and the now defunct Cup Winners' Cup.
In 2000, that changed to how it is today - the winners of the Europa League facing the winners of the Champions League.
Their prospective opponents, Paris St-Germain or Inter Milan, have also never lifted the trophy.
