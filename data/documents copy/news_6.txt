The UK government says the 99-year deal to lease back Diego Garcia will cost the UK £101m a year. They say that means the total costs for the deal will be £3.4bn.
A senior Ministry of Defence source says the £101m is the average amount the UK will pay in each of the 99 years that the deal covers.
They say the £3.4bn figure represents the total costs in today’s money, when you account for issues such as inflation.
Under the terms of the deal, the earlier payments will be worth more, with the UK set to pay £165m to Mauritius this year (see our earlier post from Yasine Mohabuth in Port Louis).
Due to inflation, by the end of the 99-year deal, the amount the UK is paying will be worth far less in real-terms.
